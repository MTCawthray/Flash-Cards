# ‚ú® Flash Cards üìù

## Abstract
+ _Flash Cards_ is a game played in your terminal where you work your way through a deck of cards, each one presenting you with a multiple choice question. Select your answer and receive instant feedback on the results. At the end of the round (when the cards run out) you are presented with your percentage passing score!
